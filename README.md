Weather App

Introduction to Web Programming-LUT Course Project (2025)

The Super Weather App is a responsive weather forecasting application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for cities, view real-time weather information, check 24-hour and 7-day forecasts, and compare data from multiple weather APIs.

The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing web app that presents accurate and detailed weather information while demonstrating solid frontend development skills using core web technologies.
